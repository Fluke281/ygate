# ygate

This software will turn your Yaesu radio into an APRS igate.

Hook your Yaesu amateur radio with APRS up to a Linux pc (raspberry pi) with
a USB cable.  Set the radio to emit "packet" data in nmea9 format over the
data port.  This script will login to an aprsis server, and relay the
packet data after reformatting the reduculous output from the radio into
real APRS packet strings.

Be sure to set your callsign and password and position in the script.
